This repo contains a interactive demo for the A3C algorithms. Use the command line below to start it

`python main.py `

The command above will first of all, launch an interactive environment, where the user can play the game using the control keys: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT. And it will record the performance for 30 seconds and shut it down.Then it will launch a new environment where the agent plays the game with the pre-trained model and record the performance. At last, it will save the comparison as an output video.
